Description: If BDAT is installed on your computer and you're using a 32bit R version, you can simply load specific BDAT functions in R. 
    Since BDAT is written in fortran, this package depends on a BDATPRO_R.dll to import. 
    Furthermore it converts the fortran code in R functions that supports your work with BDAT in R.
