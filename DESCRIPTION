Title: Imports functions of windows programm BDAT in R
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Simon Pöschl, Christian Vonderach

Description: If you're running on a Windows 32bit system, you can simply load 
  associated BDAT functions and subroutines within R wrapper functions, which
  are pretty easy to use. Since BDAT is originally written in fortran, this 
  package depends on a Windows 32bit OS, because tests to directly include the 
  Fortran-source code into the building of the package were unfortunately not 
  successful. Therefore BDAT is still restricted to windows.
