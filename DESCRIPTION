Title: Imports functions of windows programm BDAT in R
Version: 0.2.0
Author: Simon Pöschl, Christian Vonderach
Maintainer: Simon Pöschl <Simon.Poeschl@forst.bwl.de>
Description: If the BDATPro-Programm is installed on your computer and you're 
  using a 32bit R version, you can simply load the associated BDAT-dll and use the
  BDAT-functions in R. Since BDAT is originally written in fortran, this package 
  depends on the installation and availability of BDATPRO_R.dll and its import. 
  Tests to directly include the Fortran-source code into the building of the 
  package were unfortunately not successful, hence BDAT is still restricted to
  windows.
